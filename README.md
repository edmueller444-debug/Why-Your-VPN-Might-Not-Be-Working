# Why Your VPN Might Not Be Working

This repository explores common reasons why VPN connections fail and how to troubleshoot them. It is designed as an educational guide to help both beginners and experienced users understand VPN issues.

## Common Reasons for VPN Failures

1. **Incorrect Configuration**

   * Using the wrong server address, port, or protocol can prevent a VPN from connecting.
   * Always double-check your VPN client settings against your server configuration.

2. **Network Restrictions**

   * Some networks block VPN protocols or ports.
   * Firewalls and ISP restrictions can prevent VPN traffic from reaching the server.

3. **Expired Credentials or Account Issues**

   * Free and paid VPN accounts may stop working if credentials are outdated or account limits are reached.

4. **Server Problems**

   * The VPN server might be offline or overloaded.
   * Ensure your server is running and accessible from your location.

5. **Protocol Compatibility**

   * Some VPN clients may not support the protocol your server uses (like VLESS or OpenVPN).
   * Check the client and server documentation for supported protocols.

6. **Device or OS Issues**

   * Outdated operating systems, firewall settings, or antivirus software can interfere with VPN connections.

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. Verify VPN server status and logs.
2. Test different protocols (VLESS, WireGuard, OpenVPN).
3. Check firewall and antivirus settings on your device.
4. Try connecting from a different network or device.
